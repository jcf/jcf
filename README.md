### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Long time lover of Physics and mathematics. Childhood programmer. Currently interested in knowledge graphs, distributed systems, cryptography, and deep learning.

- Functional programming (immutability, function composition, referential transparency)
- Being explicit and declarative
- Documentation and tests (be a considerate coder)

#### Technologies
