### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Long time lover of Physics and mathematics. Childhood programmer. Currently interested in knowledge graphs, distributed systems, cryptography, and deep learning.

I like building products and businesses and gravitate towards tech leadership roles.

#### Things I appreciate when coding

- Ortholinear, split keyboards
- Linux & macOS
- Emacs with evil-mode
- Structural editing
- Functional programming (immutability, function composition, referential transparency)
- Being explicit and declarative
- Documentation and tests (be a considerate coder)

#### Technologies

- Clojure & JVM
- Web/APIs (performance, SEO, e-commerce)
- Auth{N,Z} having built both OAuth clients and servers
- Datomic, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, DynamoDB, Redis
- AWS, GCP, Azure, Terraform, K8s

#### Random things you'll hear me say

- Productivity over presence
- Optimise for learning
- Anything not on the board that needs to be?
- Collaborate, deliver, reflect, improve
- Catch you in Slack
